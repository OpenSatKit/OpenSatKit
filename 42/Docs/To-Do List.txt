42 Chore List

Move Wheel Torques from 42dynamics.c to 42actuators.c.

Learn how to get modal integrals from NASTRAN.

Read FITS files(?) (for better sky cubes)

Covariance analysis for prox ops, cometary ops, maybe attitude slews?

Fine formation control via wavefront sensing.

Redo POV: Track any point fixed in S/C, not just cm.

KNOWN BUG:  The first body of the first S/C, the first material stomps over any other materials.  This is somehow caused by Geom not being properly initialized.  Subsequent Geom's are fine.  For UVIS, I kludged a fix by making Geom[0] a "sacrificial cube".  Find a better way.

KNOWN BUG:  With the introduction of MinorBody, we need to check whether an orbit center is a World or a MinorBody.  Some corrections have been made, but all occurrences need to be reviewed.

Draw Ground stations in Cam.

Thruster plume model.  Pressure and visualization.

Geometrical optics.  Wavefront shape through multiple reflections (and 
lenses?).

Option to use simplified projected-area model for surface forces.

Import from compressed image files (jpg rather than ppm)

Poly-level and pixel-level surface force models.

Lunar descent/ascent.

Instrument FOV view.  Use for docking camera as well as instruments.

Migrate ST and CSS windows from SatCam to 42.

Implement commands in Prototype.rtf
