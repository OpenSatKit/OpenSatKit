# cFS Kit File Management Demo (FMD)
#
# Notes:
#   1. FMD_INSTRUCT_x variables are used to put text on the demo screen's
#      text box. The FMD_INFO_x variables are used for extra detailed
#      information that is displayed on a separate screen.
#   2. Debug events are enabled for the apps used during the demo.
#   3. A conscious effort was made to choose between direct COSMOS cmd() and
#      Osk::flight.xxx.send_cmd(). cmd() has no verification and has faster
#      response while the Osk method verifies the command and is slower. If
#      a demo button is repeatedly pushes that causes an error it's good to 
#      notify the user. If enabling debug messages fails then it's no big deal.

The TFTP App is configured as a server and the COSMOS ground system is configured as a client. COSMOS \
does not come with TFTP support so an open source GEM has been installed.\n\n\
\
The File Management screen contains telemetry from two FM packets. The housekeeping packet provides command \
counters and the directory listing packet provides information about a specific directory that is \
is sent in response to the SEND_DIR_PKT command."

The SEND_DIR_PKT command takes an offset argument that specifies the starting index into \
the directory listing. An offset of 0 is used throughout this demo.\n\n\
\
FM's WRITE_DIR_TO_FILE cmd can be used to write an entire directory listing to a file.\n\n\
\
Application command execution counters typically mean a command has been successfully processed. \
However there are often situations when a command may take a while to process and the activity can \
occur in the background. In these situations a child task performs the function and its command \
execution counters (pass/fail) indicate whether the command was completed successfully. The parent \
application's execution counter simply means the command was successfully/unsuccessfully parsed and \
passed to the child task."
