# SimpleSat Request Telemetry Class
#
# Used to as a background thread that requests status telemetry packets so 
# DS and FM telemetry points are updated
#
# Notes:
#   1. This script is part of a training module. It is for illustrative
#      purposes and not intended to be an actual ops script. 
#   2. This script is ignorant of whether a ground contact is being
#      simulated as active or inactive. 
#   3. Threading doesn't seem to be supported by ScripRunner so a new 
#      new thread must be started from the TlmViewer script if this is
#      used as part of a screen driven demo.  
#
# Global Script Variables:
#   None - Global variables should not be used since the some are called by
#          screen scripts (i.e. TlmViewer) and others by ScriptRunner and
#          they have different runtime environments.
